# Cloudflare Workers Deployment Guide

## Issue Summary

The deployment was failing because:
1. The original `main_worker.go` was not properly structured for Cloudflare Workers
2. The build process was succeeding but the deploy phase couldn't find the built file
3. The code was trying to use Gin framework which isn't compatible with Cloudflare Workers

## Solution Implemented

1. **Simplified Code Structure**: Created a minimal Cloudflare Workers-compatible Go file using standard `net/http` handlers
2. **Proper Entry Point**: Used `//export HandleRequest` for the Cloudflare Workers entry point
3. **Basic Routing**: Implemented simple routing for all API endpoints
4. **CORS Support**: Added proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests

## Current Status

The code is now properly structured for Cloudflare Workers deployment. The main changes include:

- Removed Gin framework dependencies
- Simplified to use standard `net/http` handlers
- Added proper export directive for Cloudflare Workers
- Implemented basic API endpoints with mock data

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Ensure Cloudflare CLI is installed**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. **Login to Cloudflare**:
   ```bash
   wrangler login
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
   ```

4. **Create D1 databases** (if not already created):
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 create flowgrid-db-dev
   wrangler d1 create flowgrid-db
   ```

5. **Deploy using the provided script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy.sh
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

   Or for production:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh production
   ```

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are now available:

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `GET /projects` - Get all projects
- `GET /projects/{id}` - Get specific project
- `GET /projects/sprint/{id}` - Get sprint progress
- `GET /tasks` - Get all tasks grouped by status
- `GET /tasks/status` - Get tasks by specific status

## Testing

After deployment, test the API:

```bash
curl https://your-worker.workers.dev/health
```

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. Check that the `dist/main` file is being created during build
2. Verify Cloudflare account permissions
3. Check that all required environment variables are set
4. Review Cloudflare Workers logs with `wrangler tail`

## Future Enhancements

- Implement actual database integration with D1
- Add proper authentication with JWT
- Implement real business logic for all endpoints
- Add input validation and error handling
